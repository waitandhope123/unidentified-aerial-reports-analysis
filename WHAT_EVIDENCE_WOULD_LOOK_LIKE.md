# What Evidence Would Look Like

This document explains what kinds of signals or patterns would reasonably be expected in civilian UAP reporting data if a genuinely non-ordinary phenomenon were occurring at scale.

It exists to clarify evidenti standards and to distinguish between compelling individual accounts and population-level indicators.

## Why This Matters

Discussions of unidentified aerial phenomena often focus on individual cases, dramatic encounters, or subjective impressions. However, large datasets allow a different question to be asked:

**What patterns would appear if something external, persistent, and non-human were interacting with Earth’s environment?**

This file outlines those expectations.

## The Core Expectation: Decoupling From Human Factors

The single strongest indicator of a genuine external phenomenon would be a **partial decoupling from human variables**.

Currently, civilian UAP reports are strongly correlated with:
- population density
- media attention and reporting norms
- cultural expectations
- available descriptive metaphors
- changes in human technology

A real external phenomenon would not fully track these variables.

## Expected Signals in Data

### 1. Persistent Geometric Structure

One would expect:
- repeated sky directions or celestial coordinates
- recurrence tied to Earth’s position in its orbit
- similar structure across decades

This structure would persist even as cultures, technologies, and reporting systems change.

---

### 2. Instrumental or Cross-Observer Convergence

Even with imperfect data, a real phenomenon should produce:
- correlations across independent observers
- consistency between unrelated reporting populations
- patterns that survive time-shuffling and control tests

Human-driven patterns typically collapse under such controls.

---

### 3. Era Independence

A genuine phenomenon would appear with broadly similar characteristics:
- before aviation
- during early aviation
- during the space age

Descriptions might vary slightly, but underlying structure would remain stable.

In contrast, human-driven reports show strong metaphor drift tied to contemporary technology.

---

### 4. Non-Shrinking Residuals

As data quality improves, a real phenomenon’s signal should:
- become clearer
- occupy a stable or growing fraction of reports
- resist improved explanatory models

In many observational sciences, unexplained signals sharpen over time.

In civilian UAP data, unexplained fractions remain small and stable, consistent with uncertainty rather than anomaly.

## What Is *Not* Sufficient Evidence

The following, while often compelling at an individual level, do not constitute population-level evidence:

- vivid or emotionally intense encounters
- multiple witnesses without independence
- authority or credential of observers
- radar or sensor claims without accessible data
- longevity of a narrative

These factors affect confidence, not diagnostic power.

---

## Why Large-Scale Analysis Is Necessary

Individual cases can always remain ambiguous. Large datasets allow testing whether ambiguity itself behaves unusually.

If something non-ordinary were occurring, it would leave:
- faint but persistent structure
- repeatable statistical fingerprints
- signals independent of human belief systems

The absence of such structure is itself informative.

---

## Interpretation Principle

This repository does not claim that all unidentified reports are explained, nor that future discoveries are impossible.

It claims only that:
- civilian reporting data does not currently exhibit the patterns expected of a persistent, non-human external phenomenon.

This distinction is critical.

## Closing Note

Extraordinary claims do not require extraordinary skepticism — they require **clear expectations**.

This document outlines those expectations so that future discussions can be grounded in evidence rather than intuition.
