# Conclusion

This analysis examined large-scale patterns in civilian reports of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) spanning approximately 1900–2024. Rather than focusing on individual cases, the objective was to determine whether the aggregate reporting record exhibits signatures that require extraordinary explanations, or whether it aligns with known phenomena and human observational limits.

## Summary of Findings

- After data cleaning and conservative controls, approximately **75%** of reports remained unaccounted for by direct numerical subtraction.
- Applying empirically established rates from independent research fields (aviation safety, psychology, eyewitness studies, and human factors) indicates that **~95–98%** of reports are consistent with normal phenomena and human perceptual and reporting effects.
- A small remainder (**~2–5%**, or roughly **11,000–29,000 reports**) remains unclassified due to data resolution limits, not demonstrated anomalous behavior.
- The size and persistence of this remainder closely match uncertainty tails observed in other large-scale human observational sciences.

## Interpretation

The civilian UAP reporting record behaves like a complex human observation system responding to ambiguous stimuli near the limits of perception. Known physical phenomena—combined with expectation, misperception, physiological constraints, and reporting artifacts—are sufficient to explain the vast majority of reports at the population level.

Crucially, no statistical evidence was found for:
- Organized or strategic geographic targeting
- Persistent revisit patterns
- Technological evolution signatures
- Military-style operational behavior
- Long-term non-human reconnaissance activity

The absence of these signatures is meaningful given the volume, duration, and global scope of the data.

## What the Results Do Not Imply

- Unclassified does not imply extraordinary.
- The results do not identify the causes of individual sightings.
- The analysis does not rule on classified military systems or non-public sensor data.
- No claim is made regarding extraterrestrial or non-human technology.

The conclusions are limited to what can be inferred from civilian reporting data and population-level statistical analysis.

## Final Statement

At the scale examined, civilian UAP reports are best understood as largely explainable through ordinary phenomena interacting with well-documented limits of human perception and reporting. The small residual of unclassified cases reflects expected uncertainty rather than evidence of unknown or non-human activity.

This outcome is consistent with patterns seen across other scientific domains that rely on human-reported observations under uncertainty.
