# Unidentified Aerial Reports Analysis

This repository contains a large-scale statistical analysis of civilian reports of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), spanning approximately 1900–2024.

The purpose of this project is not to determine the nature of individual sightings, but to evaluate whether aggregate reporting patterns are consistent with extraordinary causes, or whether they can be explained by known physical phenomena combined with well-documented limits of human perception, cognition, and reporting behavior.

## Scope

- Civilian sighting reports only  
- Global coverage across multiple datasets  
- Population-level statistical analysis  
- Focus on patterns, residuals, and explanatory limits  

This work does **not** attempt case-by-case identification or attribution.

## Summary of Approach

At a high level, the analysis proceeds as follows:

1. Multiple public UFO/UAP datasets were unioned, cleaned, and deduplicated.
2. Reports were separated by time precision to avoid timestamp artifacts.
3. Extreme temporal bursts and publication-day spikes were identified and controlled.
4. Timestamps were normalized to approximate UTC where possible.
5. High-confidence atmospheric fireball events were cross-matched and subtracted.
6. Remaining reports were evaluated against known rates of human perceptual error and reporting bias, using findings from aviation safety, psychology, and eyewitness research.

## Key Findings

- Approximately **95–98%** of reports are consistent with known phenomena and empirically measured human factors.
- A small remainder (**~2–5%**) remains unclassified due to data and resolution limits, a proportion comparable to uncertainty tails in other observational sciences.
- No statistical evidence was found for organized, intentional, non-human reconnaissance behavior in the civilian reporting record.

Unclassified does **not** imply extraordinary; it reflects methodological limits.

## What This Project Does Not Claim

- No claim of extraterrestrial or non-human technology  
- No claim that witnesses are deceptive or irrational  
- No claim that all cases are fully explained  

The analysis is descriptive and statistical, not speculative.

## Limitations

- Civilian reports lack consistent sensor corroboration.
- Satellite visibility was evaluated at a population level, not event-by-event.
- Meteor shower calendars and detailed aircraft flight data were not exhaustively modeled.
- Results apply to aggregate behavior, not individual sightings.

## Conclusion

The civilian UAP reporting record behaves similarly to other large-scale human observational datasets: most reports are explainable through ordinary causes and perception limits, with a small, persistent remainder reflecting uncertainty rather than evidence of extraordinary phenomena.
