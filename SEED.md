# Project Context

This document records the context, motivation, and reasoning behind this repository. It exists to preserve intent and prevent misinterpretation of the work over time.

## Why This Project Exists

Public discussion of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) often oscillates between two extremes:
- uncritical belief in extraordinary explanations, or
- outright dismissal without structured analysis.

This project was created to explore a narrower, more disciplined question:

**Do large-scale civilian reports of unidentified aerial phenomena contain statistical signatures that suggest organized, non-human activity, or are they consistent with known phenomena and human observational limits?**

The goal was not to debunk or confirm any belief, but to evaluate what the data can reasonably support.

---

## Initial Hypothesis Space

At the outset, multiple possibilities were considered plausible, including:

- Misidentification of known natural or human-made phenomena
- Human perceptual and cognitive limitations
- Reporting and publication artifacts
- Rare atmospheric or astronomical effects
- Theoretical long-term non-human reconnaissance activity

No hypothesis was assumed correct in advance.

## Why Civilian Reporting Data Was Used

Civilian UAP reports span:
- more than a century (~1900–2024),
- multiple cultures and technologies,
- pre-aviation, aviation, and spaceflight eras.

If long-running non-human reconnaissance existed, it was reasoned that **some statistical trace should be visible in aggregate civilian reporting**, especially in early eras when skies were otherwise empty.

This made civilian data a useful *negative test*: not to prove existence, but to test for expected signatures.

---

## Analytical Philosophy

Several principles guided the analysis:

- **Population-level patterns matter more than individual cases**
- **Absence of expected structure is informative**
- **Unclassified does not imply extraordinary**
- **Conclusions must scale with data quality**
- **Human perception is part of the system being measured**

Where data resolution was insufficient, uncertainty was preserved rather than forced into explanation.

---

## What Was Done

In summary, the analysis:
- Combined multiple public UFO/UAP datasets into a large union
- Controlled for timestamp artifacts and reporting spikes
- Identified and bounded known atmospheric events
- Normalized times conservatively
- Evaluated residual patterns against empirically established human perceptual and reporting error rates
- Compared remaining uncertainty to other observational sciences

This process is documented in detail in `METHOD.md`.

---

## What Was Found

At the population level:
- The vast majority of reports are consistent with ordinary phenomena interacting with human perception and reporting behavior.
- The size of the unresolved remainder (~2–5%) closely matches uncertainty tails seen in aviation safety, medicine, astronomy, and eyewitness research.
- No statistical evidence was found for organized, strategic, or persistent non-human reconnaissance activity.
- Pre-aviation data shows less structure, not more, which argues against hidden technological presence.

These findings do not depend on assuming witnesses are deceptive or irrational.

---

## What This Project Does *Not* Claim

This repository does not claim:
- proof or disproof of extraterrestrial life
- identification of individual sightings
- access to classified information
- insight into military or intelligence programs

It addresses **what civilian reporting data can and cannot support**, and nothing more.

---

## Why the Project Stops Here

Further progress would require:
- event-level satellite visibility modeling,
- meteor shower integration,
- or multi-sensor corroboration.

Those are different projects requiring different data.

Stopping here reflects analytical discipline, not lack of curiosity.

---

## Intended Audience

This repository is intended for:
- technically curious readers
- skeptics and proponents alike
- researchers interested in human observation systems
- anyone seeking a calm, evidence-bounded discussion of UAP data

It is not intended as advocacy.

---

## Closing Note

If future readers take only one thing from this repository, it should be this:

**The absence of extraordinary conclusions here is itself an informative result.**

It suggests that civilian UAP reports behave like other large-scale human observational datasets—complex, imperfect, and mostly explainable without invoking extraordinary causes.

That is a meaningful outcome.
