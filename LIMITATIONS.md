# Limitations

This analysis is intentionally conservative and bounded. The following limitations are acknowledged explicitly to avoid overinterpretation of the results.

---

## Civilian Reporting Only

All primary data consists of civilian sighting reports. These reports:

- Lack standardized instrumentation
- Are subject to individual perception and memory
- Rarely include independent sensor corroboration

As a result, conclusions apply to **aggregate reporting behavior**, not to the objective identification of individual aerial events.

---

## Variable Data Quality

Data quality varies widely across reports and eras:

- Many records lack precise times or locations
- Some reports use default or placeholder timestamps
- Free-text descriptions are subjective and inconsistent
- Older reports are influenced by historical reporting practices

These factors limit the resolution of event-level classification.

---

## No Event-Level Satellite Visibility Modeling

Satellite influence was evaluated at a **population level** using public satellite databases.

This analysis did **not** perform:
- Orbit propagation
- Illumination modeling
- Ground-track visibility matching at the time of individual sightings

As a result, some satellite-related sightings may remain within the unclassified remainder.

---

## Limited Atmospheric and Aviation Context

While high-confidence fireball events were cross-matched, this analysis did not exhaustively model:

- Meteor shower calendars
- Aircraft flight paths
- Reentry events
- Atmospheric optical phenomena at local scales

These factors likely account for a portion of the remaining uncertainty.

---

## Theoretical Classification Uses External Rates

The narrowing of the residual using human perceptual and cognitive factors is based on:

- Empirically established rates from aviation safety
- Psychology and eyewitness research
- Human factors and physiological studies

These rates are applied conservatively and at a population level. They are not direct measurements from the UAP dataset itself.

---

## Unclassified Does Not Imply Extraordinary

The remaining unclassified fraction reflects:

- Limits of available data
- Limits of population-level analysis
- Expected uncertainty tails seen in other observational sciences

Unclassified reports should not be interpreted as evidence of unknown technology or non-human activity.

---

## Scope Boundaries

This project does not attempt to address:

- Classified military sensor data
- Case-by-case investigation of individual reports
- Claims based on physical evidence, materials analysis, or sensor fusion

The conclusions are specific to the datasets and methods described.

---

## Summary

These limitations are not weaknesses but boundaries. They define what can and cannot be inferred from civilian UAP reporting data and help ensure that conclusions remain proportional to the evidence available.
