# Future Work and Expansion

This repository documents a bounded analysis of civilian unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP) reports using publicly available data and population-level statistical methods. The conclusions reflect the limits of the data and methods applied.

Further progress would require **new kinds of data or modeling**, not simply more reports. The following outlines how the analysis could be expanded in a disciplined way.

---

## 1. Event-Level Satellite Visibility Modeling

A major limitation of civilian data is the lack of precise attribution for satellite-related sightings.

Future work could include:
- Orbit propagation using historical Two-Line Element (TLE) data
- Illumination and visibility modeling from ground locations
- Event-by-event matching against reported sighting times and locations

This would allow a more precise quantification of satellite contributions to the residual.

## 2. Meteor Shower and Minor Meteor Modeling

While high-confidence fireballs were cross-matched, smaller meteors and meteor showers were not exhaustively modeled.

Future expansion could:
- Integrate International Meteor Organization (IMO) shower calendars
- Weight sightings by shower activity windows
- Distinguish diffuse meteor activity from isolated atmospheric events

---

## 3. Aviation Context Integration

Civilian aircraft are a known source of visual ambiguity, particularly at night and at long distances.

Future analysis could incorporate:
- Historical air traffic density by region and year
- Known flight corridor overlays
- Temporal correlations with aviation growth

This would further reduce the unclassified remainder.

---

## 4. Environmental and Optical Effects

More detailed atmospheric modeling could be applied, including:
- Local cloud cover and visibility
- Temperature inversions
- Astronomical seeing conditions

These factors influence perception but require higher-resolution weather data.

---

## 5. Case Subset Analysis

Rather than expanding volume, future work could focus on:
- Detailed analysis of the remaining unclassified subset
- Stratification by era, geography, and report characteristics
- Identification of recurring description motifs

This would help distinguish data-quality limits from genuinely rare configurations.

---

## 6. Multi-Sensor Corroboration

Meaningful reduction of uncertainty would ultimately require:
- Radar, optical, infrared, or other sensor data
- Independent confirmation beyond human observers

Such data is generally not publicly available and lies outside the scope of this repository.

---

## Guiding Principle

Any future expansion should maintain the same principles applied here:
- Conservative assumptions
- Transparent methods
- Clear distinction between data limits and inference
- Avoidance of speculative conclusions

The goal is refinement, not escalation.

## Closing Note

The absence of extraordinary conclusions in this repository reflects analytical discipline, not a lack of curiosity. This work defines what civilian reporting data can support and where its explanatory boundaries lie.
