# Results

This section summarizes the quantitative outcomes of the analysis. Percentages are approximate and reflect population-level behavior rather than precise classification of individual reports.

## Dataset Summary

- **Total reports analyzed:** ~570,000
- **Time span:** ~1900–2024
- **Geographic scope:** Global (civilian reports)

---

## Direct Subtractions and Controls

The following factors were explicitly identified and controlled using data-driven methods:

- Extreme short-duration temporal bursts (minutes to hours)
- Extreme publication-day spikes in date-only records
- Timestamp artifacts related to default or missing times
- Strictly matched atmospheric fireball events

After these steps:

- **Residual reports:** ~425,000
- **Residual proportion:** ~75% of total reports

---

## Fireball Coincidence Results

Using strict temporal and spatial matching criteria:

- **Exact-time reports evaluated:** ~160,000
- **Fireball matches identified:** ~50–60
- **Fraction explained by fireballs:** ~0.03–0.04%

This indicates that cataloged atmospheric fireballs account for only a very small fraction of reports under conservative matching assumptions.

---

## Theoretical Classification of the Residual

Using empirically established rates from independent research fields (aviation safety, psychology, eyewitness research, and human factors):

- **Estimated explainable by normal human factors:** ~70–75% of all reports
- **Includes:** perceptual misjudgment, expectation effects, physiological limits, and reporting artifacts

This estimate aligns closely with the measured residual size.

---

## Final Unclassified Remainder

After combining direct subtraction with theoretical narrowing:

- **Unclassified remainder:** ~2–5% of all reports
- **Approximate count:** ~11,000–29,000 sightings

These reports cannot be confidently classified using available civilian data and population-level analysis alone.

---

## Temporal Distribution of the Remainder

- Unclassified reports are distributed across the full study period.
- No evidence of increasing anomaly fraction over time was observed.
- Early (pre-aviation) and modern eras show similar proportional behavior.

---

## Key Negative Findings

No statistical evidence was found for:

- Organized or strategic geographic targeting
- Persistent revisit patterns
- Technological evolution signatures
- Military-style operational behavior
- Long-term non-human reconnaissance patterns

---

## Summary

At the population level, the civilian UAP reporting record behaves similarly to other large-scale human observational datasets: most reports are consistent with ordinary phenomena and human perceptual limits, with a small, stable remainder reflecting uncertainty rather than demonstrable extraordinary causes.
