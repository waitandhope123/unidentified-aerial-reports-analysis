## Overview

This project was initiated to evaluate whether large-scale civilian reports of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) show statistical patterns consistent with extraordinary causes, or whether they can be explained through known phenomena and human observational limits.

The work was conducted as an exploratory, population-level analysis rather than a case-by-case investigation.

## Role of the Repository Author

The repository author:

- Defined the core research question
- Identified and sourced all datasets used in the analysis
- Determined which explanatory hypotheses were worth testing
- Guided the scope, direction, and stopping points of the analysis
- Made all final decisions regarding interpretation and presentation
- Chose to emphasize conservative, non-sensational conclusions

All data selection, inclusion decisions, and analytical direction were author-driven.

## Role of Analytical Assistance

An AI-based analytical assistant was used as a **support tool** to:

- Help reason through statistical approaches
- Suggest ways to structure and validate analysis steps
- Assist in summarizing findings clearly and consistently
- Help draft documentation that accurately reflects the analysis performed

The assistant did **not** introduce independent datasets, assumptions, or conclusions without author review and approval. All interpretations were discussed and explicitly accepted before inclusion.

## Analytical Process Summary

At a high level, the analysis followed these steps:

1. Multiple public UFO/UAP datasets were combined into a single union dataset.
2. Records were cleaned, standardized, and deduplicated.
3. Reports were separated based on time precision to avoid timestamp artifacts.
4. Extreme temporal bursts and publication artifacts were identified and controlled.
5. Reported times were normalized to approximate UTC where possible.
6. High-confidence atmospheric fireball events were cross-matched and conservatively subtracted.
7. Remaining reports were evaluated against empirically established rates of human perceptual error, expectation effects, physiological limits, and reporting artifacts.
8. The size and structure of the remaining unclassified fraction were compared to uncertainty tails observed in other scientific domains.

At each step, the goal was to avoid over-attribution and to preserve uncertainty where data resolution was insufficient.

## Interpretation Principles

Several principles guided interpretation:

- Aggregate patterns are more informative than individual reports
- Unclassified does not imply extraordinary
- Absence of expected operational signatures is meaningful
- Conclusions should not exceed what the data can support

These principles informed both methodological choices and final conclusions.

## Final Responsibility

The repository author accepts full responsibility for:

- The framing of the analysis
- The interpretation of results
- Any errors or omissions

The conclusions represent the author’s assessment of the evidence, based on the methods and data described.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository is intended to:

- Document a transparent analytical process
- Clarify what civilian UAP data can and cannot support
- Serve as a reference for further discussion or critique
- Avoid speculative or sensational claims

It is not intended to promote any particular belief regarding the nature of unidentified aerial phenomena.
