# Detection Limits

This document explains the limits of what large-scale civilian UAP reporting data can and cannot detect. It clarifies why the absence of a detected signal does not imply absolute absence, while still placing meaningful constraints on possible activity levels.

## Why Detection Limits Matter

The analysis in this repository evaluates population-level patterns across approximately 570,000 civilian UAP reports spanning more than a century.

Such analyses are powerful for identifying persistent, large-scale, or structured phenomena. However, they are inherently limited in their ability to detect extremely rare or low-probability events.

Understanding these limits prevents overinterpretation of both positive and negative results.

## Signal vs Noise in Civilian Reporting Data

On average, the dataset contains approximately:

- **~4,500 reports per year** globally

Natural year-to-year variation in reporting is substantial. A simple statistical approximation places normal fluctuation on the order of:

- **±60–70 reports per year** (1σ)

To confidently identify a new population-level signal, an effect typically needs to exceed this background variability by a substantial margin.

As a rule of thumb, signals smaller than **~200 reported events per year** are difficult to distinguish from noise using aggregate statistics alone.

## Reporting Probability

Not every real-world event results in a civilian report.

Let:
- **E** = true number of events per year (globally)
- **p** = probability an event is reported and recorded
- **R = E × p** = expected number of recorded reports per year

The reporting probability **p** is unknown and likely small for rare, brief, or ambiguous events.

Illustrative scenarios:

- If **p ≈ 10%** (optimistic), then detecting a signal requires **E ≈ 2,000 events/year**
- If **p ≈ 1%** (more realistic), detection requires **E ≈ 20,000 events/year**
- If **p ≈ 0.1%**, detection requires **E ≈ 200,000 events/year**

These values represent approximate thresholds for population-level detectability.

## Implications for Interpretation

This analysis can confidently constrain or exclude:

- High-rate, persistent activity
- Structured or recurring phenomena
- Activity that would generate hundreds of civilian reports per year
- Long-term reconnaissance or routine operations at scale

However, it cannot exclude:

- Extremely rare events (tens to hundreds per year globally)
- Events occurring primarily over oceans or unpopulated regions
- Events with very low probability of observation or reporting
- Activity intentionally designed to minimize visibility

Such phenomena could exist without leaving a detectable statistical footprint in civilian reporting data.

## Why This Does Not Undermine the Main Findings

The primary conclusions of this repository concern **large-scale patterns** and **population behavior**.

The absence of detectable structure indicates that:
- no persistent, high-rate external phenomenon is interacting with civilian observers
- unexplained reports behave like normal uncertainty tails seen in other observational sciences

Acknowledging detection limits does not weaken these conclusions; it properly bounds them.

## Summary

Civilian UAP reporting data is well-suited for detecting widespread, recurring, or structured phenomena. It is not well-suited for detecting extremely rare events.

This repository therefore constrains what *cannot* be happening at scale, while remaining agnostic about phenomena occurring below the threshold of statistical detectability.
