## Civilian UAP / UFO Reports

Multiple public UFO/UAP sighting databases were combined to form a union dataset. These sources collect reports submitted voluntarily by civilian observers.

Examples of commonly used sources include:

- National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC)
- Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) public data releases
- Historical UFO sighting compilations and archives
- Publicly available aggregated datasets (e.g., Kaggle-hosted collections)

These datasets typically include:
- Date and time of sighting (with variable precision)
- Location information (city, state, country; sometimes coordinates)
- Free-text descriptions
- Submission or report dates

The analysis treats these sources descriptively and does not assume uniform accuracy or completeness.

## Atmospheric Fireballs

- **NASA Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS)**
- Public fireball event catalog derived from U.S. Government sensors

This dataset provides:
- Time and approximate location of high-energy atmospheric entry events
- Radiated energy estimates

Fireball data was used conservatively to identify high-confidence atmospheric explanations.

---

## Satellites

- **Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) Satellite Database**
- Public satellite catalog snapshots and derivatives

This data includes:
- Satellite launch year
- Orbital class (LEO, MEO, GEO, HEO)
- Operational status
- Country and purpose

Satellite data was used at a population level to assess growth trends, not for event-level attribution.

---

## Asteroids and Near-Earth Objects

- Public NASA / JPL-derived asteroid and NEO datasets
- Aggregated and redistributed via open data platforms

These datasets provide:
- Discovery dates
- Orbital characteristics
- Close-approach statistics

They were used for macro-scale temporal context only.

---

## Meteorites

- **Meteoritical Society Meteorite Landing Database**
- Public records of recovered meteorites

This dataset includes:
- Location
- Year of fall or discovery
- Classification and mass (when available)

Meteorite data was used to assess rarity and spatial distribution, not sky visibility.

---

## Weather and Climate Data

- Public annual or multi-year weather and climate summary datasets
- Aggregated national or global climate indicators

Weather data was used as a coarse contextual check and not as an event-level explanatory dataset.

---

## External Research Literature

Empirical rates and principles referenced in interpretation were drawn from established research in:

- Aviation safety and human factors
- Psychology and eyewitness memory
- Visual perception and cognition
- Astronomy and transient detection

These sources inform theoretical narrowing but were not used as direct data inputs.

## Source Limitations

All sources used here have known limitations, including:
- Incomplete coverage
- Reporting bias
- Variable precision
- Cultural and temporal influences

These limitations are discussed in detail in `LIMITATIONS.md`.

## Transparency Note

This repository aims to make clear what data was used, how it was used, and what it can reasonably support. The inclusion of a source does not imply endorsement of its completeness or accuracy.
